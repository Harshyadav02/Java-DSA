## Variables & DataTypes

This section talks about the variables , how to **Create Variables , Data Types in java, Type Casting ,Type Conversion**.

## Operators 
This part talk about the Operators , Operators discussed are **Arithmatic Operators , Relational Operators , Assignment Operators**.

## Conditional Statment 
Conditional Statment discussed in this section are **If-Else , Ternary Operator, Switch Statment**. 

## Loops 
Loops discussed in this repo are **For-loop , While-loop , Do-While loop and For-each loop**, Some other concept are also discussed like **Break , Continue** 

## Arrays 

In this section the topic is covered , array folder contain **Array Creation, Input of array Element , Reverse an array, Kadnas Algorithm and many more**.
## Basic Sorting Algo 
Here some **Basic Sorting** Algorithm are discussed which help to built some concept like **Time Complexity , Space Complexity**.

## 2D Array

This section covers 2D Array Concept , **how 2D Works, Creation of 2D Array, Input in 2D Array**.

## Strings 
String is an vauable concept , here **String Creation, Length(), String Concatention ,CharAt(), subString() , and StringBulider** such type of topic are covered.

## Bit Manuplation
In this topic we will talk about **BIT** , and will perform some operations like **Binary AND , Binary OR , Binary XOR, LEFTSHIFT , RIGHTSHIFT** . Some basic question are also solved for more understanding.

## OOPS
Here somes an important topic **OOPS** . Here we learn important topics like **CLASS, OBJECTS, CONSTRUCTOR, MODIFIRES, INTERFACE, ENCAPSULATION, INHERTANCE, TYPES OF INHERTANCE, ABSTRACTION, INNER CLASS, EXCEPTION HANDLING, ACCESS MODIFIERS** and many more. 
## Prerequisite 

To run the Programs you intall Java Development kit(JDK) , you can download JDK as per your system type ( [Windows](https://download.oracle.com/java/20/latest/jdk-20_windows-x64_bin.exe (sha256)) , [Linux](https://download.oracle.com/java/20/latest/jdk-20_linux-x64_bin.deb (sha256)) , [Mac](https://download.oracle.com/java/20/latest/jdk-20_macos-aarch64_bin.dmg (sha256))).

## To execute the Program 

 To complie the java file (replace filename with your file name)   
 
    `javac <filename.java>`  

 To run the file 
 
    `java <filename>` 

**NOTE : There are some basic problems in each folder which are for the practice purpose of that topic.**
